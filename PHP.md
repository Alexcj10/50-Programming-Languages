# PHP Learning and Project Resources

## Why Learn PHP?
PHP is a server-side scripting language that is primarily used to create dynamic web pages. You’ll see PHP doing things like generating interactive content, collecting form data, sending information to visitors, and authenticating users. It’s also the backbone of WordPress and its plugins, which add all sorts of unique functions to the CMS. You can do pretty much anything with PHP.

It’s also generally very easy to learn and a good starter language for new devs. If you do have a background in programming, you should tear right through it. But even total beginners won’t struggle too much navigating the ins and outs of PHP.

And if you’re diving into WordPress development, PHP is a must. It’s required to modify WordPress or write themes and plugins, and it’s the core of the whole CMS. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are also languages to look into, but none are as integral to WordPress as PHP.

The last reason to learn PHP: much like other programming languages, it has a huge community and a ton of free resources. That means you have plenty of places to turn to ask for help, exchange ideas, and download free software or find helpful guides.
